Home Youtube 
These are my first projects that I enjoyed doing and that were also necessary because my website was not the video viewing section.
Thanks to the<strong> Web Dev Simplified</strong> tutorial on<strong> youtubes</strong> I also got this page ready. Many thanks also to the<strong> pixabay</strong>
web environment for the videos.
